# Newsletter
The FWD: Think newsletter, diving into social activism weekly.

# Schedule
FWD: Think releases a newsletter weekly, along with a companion newsletter that details the process we used in creating that week's newsletter. Each newsletter covers a new topic and is available as a PDF. We release this as a PDF file under GitHub's releases section in this repository. Each release, as mentioned before, will include two files, the main letter, and a separate methodology file where each person who contributed to the weekly newsletter explains the process they used in researching, writing, and publishing their segment of the letter.

# Format
Our newsletter format will always be a simple, 2-to-5-page, easily printable, two-pages-per-sheet format. Each page is black and white and can be downloaded as individual pages or a condensed version. This means we can easily distribute each newsletter, and you can easily print copies to hand out at your local park, place them as flyers, etc. Each newsletter has one main topic, with at least two different viewpoints on how that topic can impact society for the better or worse. The newsletters are all respectful of the four pillars of journalism, meaning one page will always be added for sources, none of what we publish is in malice but rather in the interest of activism, each newsletter is cross-checked by multiple people before it is published, and we are stay independent of any political body in the interest of reporting truthfully.

# Yearly Audit
Each year we aim to do one community audit, where we give five members of the community access to our full backend, including meetings, backchannels, drafts and documents, financial information (which is also available to the public monthly), and more. After the five community members either agree to stop the audit, or three months pass, they will draft a two-page document with all the information they choose to include. This ensures transparency for the entirety of the audit period.
This does bring up the question "What happens when the audit is over?" when the audit is over we always have a paid transparency auditor who is paid by your contributions just as all of our writers, researchers, editors, and other workers are. In addition to this, they are included in the worker's co-op, meaning they get to vote on company decisions with the rest of our workers.

# Company Information Transparency
FWD: Think releases a slew of informative documents about our company written by our founder Rei Johnson and edited by our internal auditor. These documents will include information on our monthly donations, financial breakdown, company vote information, and more.

# Company Politics
Our company is a very political organization. We are a collective of anarchists, meaning we oppose central government (hence why we organize as a not-for-profit worker's cooperative.) We are very socially progressive and support people of all sexual identities, genders, occupations, religions, races, etc.
