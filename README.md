# Zines
The FWD: Think zine titled "Don't Come to Idiot America" is an unscheduled, hand-illustrated zine we encourage everyone to distribute.

# Format
The FWD: Think zine is an easily printable one-page, low-ink zine that can be easily folded up and distributed. All of our zines must comply with GitHub's policies stated 9in its terms of service. This means that we do not engage in anything overtly harmful, but we do encourage people to be more active in their communities through donating, speaking out, enjoying music, speaking up for themselves and others, and much more. We encourage all of our readers printers and distributors to also find, and maybe even make, other zines as well as ours!

## Company Information Transparency
FWD: Think releases a slew of informative documents about our company written by our founder Rei Johnson and edited by our internal auditor. These documents will include information on our monthly donations, financial breakdown, company vote information, and more.

## Company Politics
Our company is a very political organization. We are a collective of anarchists, meaning we oppose central government (hence why we organize as a not-for-profit worker's cooperative.) We are very socially progressive and support people of all sexual identities, genders, occupations, religions, races, etc.
